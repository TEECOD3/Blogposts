As I embarked on 2023, my enthusiasm to elevate my tech career, learn more, explore new technologies, and build impressive websites was palpable. I envisioned this year as an opportunity to propel my coding skills to the next level, so I meticulously laid out a plan. It is often said that what you write down, you are more likely to achieve. I documented some ambitious plans for the year, encompassing both challenging aspirations and practical goals. Primarily, my focus was on building more projects and ultimately creating a comprehensive portfolio website.

## THE JOURNEY

At the start of the year, I lacked confidence in writing CSS and struggled with building responsive websites. While I had a grasp of CSS, a basic understanding of JavaScript, and was in the process of learning React.js, building a complete landing page seemed like a daunting task. Despite being occupied with my duties as a National Youth Service Corps member, I secured two internships as a frontend developer—one unpaid and the other paid—both initiated in late 2022.

During my internships, I grappled with implementing Figma designs, finding it challenging to translate my creative visions into code. However, with consistent practice and dedication, I successfully implemented the designs, marking a turning point in my journey. Concurrently, I practiced building projects, such as [Coffee Shop](https://cofeeshop-topshi.netlify.app/) and [Weather App](https://ephemeral-kringle-20b9f7.netlify.app/). These projects, though initially challenging, significantly contributed to my learning experience. You can find my most recent projects on [my website](https://teecod3.vercel.app/).

Engaging with the JavaScripters community proved invaluable during this period. I learned extensively and received assistance from friends whenever challenges arose, providing both technical guidance and motivation. Fast forward to the conclusion of my service year; a friend recommended me for a frontend developer position at his workplace. This opportunity allowed me to work extensively on design-related projects, converting designs into functional websites using React and Next.js.

Reflecting on the past year, despite facing challenges on the home front, I persisted, fueled by the determination to pursue my dreams. It has been a remarkable year, achieving several goals and gaining hands-on experience with design-related projects.

## PLANS FOR THE NEW YEAR

As the new year approaches, I have outlined some aspirations:

- Improve my writing skills by producing more articles.
- Contribute to open-source projects.
- Develop real applications with broader usability.
- Strengthen my spiritual connection.
- Prioritize physical fitness.
- Increase financial stability to support my family.

In essence, the upcoming year holds new possibilities for growth and achievement. I am excited to continue my journey, facing challenges head-on and turning dreams into reality.
